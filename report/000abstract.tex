In this project, we investigate the possibility of using only SQL to do graph manipulations
on {\em graphMiner}. For the first stage, we implement kcore algorithms within 
{\em graphMiner} framework and have unit test on kcore and other already implemented algorithms in the system
to gain better understanding of methods like kcore, PageRank, Eigenvalue computation. We also test the algorithms
with wiki-Vote and soc-Epinions1 dataset from SNAP.
