Based on the experiments and the implementation of Kcore, we find that the Kcore algorithm can find subgraph structures effectively and we also find that the implemented algorithms in graphMiner, i.e. the pagerank, degree distribution, connected component etc works properly. 
Above this, we find that using SQL to do basic and advanced graph mining queries are viable and actually effective. We will
have future exploration into this to make better use of SQL and advantage of database.
