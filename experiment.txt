From the experiment, create index does consume system resources and it will make performance worse in general if we
created index and used it only once.

From the experiment, creatint index will improve performance in general if we created index and used it later a lot.

Also, for a certain algorithm, create index for some tables like GM_NODES are expensive, but if re run all the algorithms,
or use the algorithm multiple times, then the cost of creating index on tables like GM_NODES will be worth the effort.
